# Power-system-capacity-expansion-model
The code for Technological Dependency under Regional Net Load Stress: Decoding China's Low-Carbon Transition Pathways
To determine the optimal configuration of power generation, storage, and transmission infrastruc-ture under long-term decarbonization goals, we construct a power system capacity expansion model that minimizes the total system cost while satisfying a series of technical, operational, and environmental constraints.
